```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 1

```{r cars}
set.seed(1)
exp.draws.1 = rexp(n=200, rate=1)
mean.exp = mean(exp.draws.1)
std = sd(exp.draws.1)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
